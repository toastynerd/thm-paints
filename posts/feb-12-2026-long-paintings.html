      This painting has been "in progress" for what feels like a long time. It really hasn't been that long in
      the grand scheme of paintings. I started it in January but I haven't been making much progress on it. I'm
      currently in taking a figure drawing class at <a href="https://gageacademy.org/">Gage Academy</a>, taught by
      <a href="https://www.aronhart.com/">Aaron Hart</a> which has taken up a lot of my time and art energy.

      This is the second class in the series and it's made a night and day difference in my artwork. It's not 
      always easy and last week I abandoned and restarted my first attempt at our two session pose. 
      It was frustrating and discouraging but I'm learning and growing which is why I started taking classes.
      Change is never comfortable, which is the point.

      I enjoy still lifes. It's a recent revelation. Going into painting I thought of still lifes as boring.
      I worked a lot from printed photos and though of working from still life as needless complexity. I was wrong.
      The amount of depth and subtlty that gets lost in photos is incredible. Being able to move around an object,
      seeing the suble differences in light and shadow. All of it is lost in a photo. Real life doesn't have solid
      black shadows, photos frequently do.

      What I "want" to paint changes constantly. I'm embracing it. I'm still really early days in this journey.
      I want to challenge my assumptions and see where it takes me. At the same time I want to work who I am and
      who I have been into my work. In this case, a love of retro video games. I want to finish this before the 
      end of March. I think that's a timeline I can stick to.
